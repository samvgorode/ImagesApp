# ImagesApp. Kotlin, Coroutines, DataBinding, Unit tests, Retrofit, Room.

Android - homework
Please create an Android app that displays a scrolling list of images.
Required features:
Displaying a scrolling list of images
A detail page for individual images
Optional features:
The ability to share an image
The ability to favorite an image, and to display all favorited images
List pagination
Caching/Persistence
The images should be loaded from a remote service. E.g. stock photo site. 
Choose image quantity over quality. No emphasis is given to the quality of the images. 
You are free to choose which technologies and patterns to use, and how to architect the app.
However, please use an architecture that facilitates testing and that allows for abstractions.
Simple unit tests are expected, but not required. There's no code coverage requirement.
Prefer technologies that you know over unknown technologies. E.g. if you know Java, but not Kotlin, use Java.
Recommended tech stack options:
Kotlin
Glide
Retrofit
OkHttp
Room
RxJava
Flow
Even if it is a small application - try to design architecture in a scalable way. This might mean adding unnecessary code/package 
structures to display the concept.
Please document the choices and assumptions you make along the way. 
If the assignment is unclear please ask.
Good luck!
